Reflection 1


I Have Consistently applied the meaninfull names for naming the function
making the function small and focused,
on matter of consistency, I have created a slight error when naming things such as ProductID and ProductId causing failures on run




Reflection 2

Unit tests are testing/verifying the logic,in a repository and service methods
Functional test are testing user interactions 

1.After Checking Unit tests, i feel more concerned , because getting 100% test,it would not mean anything.
as for how many , it should be as much as we can cover every possible interaction
2.It would cause problem on readability,maintainance.
